# Mobile to Desktop Workflow Guide

## ⚠️ Important Limitation

### **Data Does NOT Sync Between Mobile and Desktop**

**localStorage is per-device, per-browser:**
- Data entered on **mobile** stays on mobile only
- Data on **desktop** stays on desktop only
- They are **completely separate**
- No automatic sync between devices

---

## ✅ Solution: Excel Export Workflow

### **Recommended Workflow:**

#### **Option 1: Export from Mobile, View on Desktop (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Daily on Mobile:**
   - Enter all transactions on mobile
   - Data saved in mobile browser's localStorage

2. **At Month End:**
   - Open website on mobile
   - Go to Sales Report
   - Click "Export to Excel"
   - Excel file downloads to mobile

3. **Transfer to Desktop:**
   - Transfer Excel file from mobile to desktop:
     - Email to yourself
     - Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
     - Use USB cable
     - Use cloud storage
   - Open Excel file on desktop
   - View all reports and data

**✅ This Works Perfectly!**

#### **Option 2: Use Same Device/Browser**

**Best Practice:**
- Use **one device** (mobile OR desktop) for all entries
- Don't switch between devices
- All data stays in one place

**If you must switch:**
- Use same browser on both devices
- Still won't sync (localStorage is device-specific)
- Better to stick to one device

---

#### **Option 3: Daily Export from Mobile**

**Daily Workflow:**
1. Enter transactions on mobile throughout the day
2. At end of day, export to Excel
3. Save Excel files daily
4. At month end, combine all Excel files on desktop

**Pros:**
- Daily backup
